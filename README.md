## 1 Installing project <br/>
### 1.1 Getting started <br/>
To run the application you need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAjwv4_1BRAhEiwAtMDLsozFvTbQdD1gDDKtKmX58Udj2DvLeoF2hyhyzdcBArlbnsQCdAUq6RoCfMYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
The project is andorid speciefied so you need two android emulators to run the multiplayer game. If you dont have an adoid device Android Studio comes with the possibility to run on an emulator (see section 1.3) <br/>

### 1.3 Running the project <br>

You can either run on an andoid device or on the emulator in Andorid Studio. You can set up two of these devices on your computer, or have one on the computer and run the game simontaniously on your android phone. The app runs faster on your phone, so we reccomend this if you have an android phone. To play multiplayer and see the highscore list, which is online, you need to have internet. <br/>

#### Andorid Emulator
You should have the latest Android Emulator version to make your emulator run faster, we reccommend version 30.5.4
We reccomend to set up this virtual device: <br/>
```bash
Name: Pixel 3a 
Size: 5,6 
Resolution: 1080x2220 
Density: 440dpi  
```
